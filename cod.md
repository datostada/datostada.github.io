__This [Don't Be a Jerk](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick) Policy Guide is based on the MLH's Code of Conduct.__


Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at Datostada, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a Datostada representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.

Datostada stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, staff, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Datostada may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Datostada using the reporting procedures defined below.

Datostada representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all Datostada venues, online interactions in relation to the event, Datostada-related social events, and on Datostada supplied transportation.

###### Reporting Procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to the Datostada Representative that is on-site at the event. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

If you are uncomfortable reporting your situation to one or more of these people or need to contact any of them directly in case of emergency, direct contact details are listed below. Incidents emailed to [hola@datostada.mx](mailto:hola@datostada.mx) may be addressed after the event.
